 # Simple Interest Calculator

A simple tool to calculate the interest charged on a loan or earned on a deposit over a specific period.

## Formula
The simple interest is calculated using the formula:
$A = P(1 + rt)$

Where:
* **A** = Total Accrued Amount (principal + interest)
* **P** = Principal Amount
* **r** = Annual Interest Rate (decimal)
* **t** = Time Period (years)

## How it Works
1.  **Input Principal:** Enter the starting amount of money.
2.  **Input Rate:** Enter the annual interest percentage.
3.  **Input Time:** Enter the number of years the money is invested or borrowed.
4.  **Calculate:** The tool multiplies these factors to provide the total interest.

## Example
If you invest **$1,000** at an annual interest rate of **5%** for **3 years**:
* Interest = $1,000 \times 0.05 \times 3 = $150
* Total Amount = $1,150
